# README: Frontend

## Introduction
- Created a next.js based React app to display the movies from the API
- Used tailwind for CSS

## Features/Considerations
- Tested on both large monitor and 15" laptop screen
- Strong contrast for accessibility (not perfect but a headway into consideration)
- Custom elements such as a large scroll bar for ease of use
- Replacement posters when the URL can't be fetched
- Newest movie first
- An error page that auto retries every 5 seconds and then 15seconds after 3 failures if there's an API issue
