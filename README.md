# WebJet coding challenge
This is my submission for the WebJet coding challenge.
It contains two folders
- webjet-entertainment-ui (React based UI with NextJS)
- WebJet.Entertainment.API (.NET 8 based backend 

- Development was done entirely on Windows with the following pre-requisites installed.
- ***Important:*** ideally these would be in two separate repositories but for the sake of this coding challenge, it was kept in one to avoid any issues with missed code etc.

## Pre-requisites for development
### Frontend
- npm: 9.7.1
- node: v20.9.0

### Backend
- .NET 8.0 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
